                <p>First we will prepare our <strong>Fees Structure</strong> for Current Session by configuring
                    <strong>Fees Type</strong>, <strong>Fees Group</strong>, <strong>Fees Master</strong> and
                    <strong>Fees Reminder</strong> then we will <strong>Collect Fees</strong> of students then we will
                    understand and review various fees reports by using <strong>Search Fees Payment</strong>,
                    <strong>Search Due Fees</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>Lets understand how we will create fees structure in Edu Smart Campus by using <strong>Fees
                        Type</strong>, <strong>Fees Group</strong> &amp; <strong>Fees Master</strong>. <strong>Fees
                        Type</strong> means different types of fees can be collect by school e.g. Admission Fees, April
                    Month Fees, May Month Fees, June Month Fees, Exam Fees, Dress/Uniform Fees, Library Fees, Sports
                    Fees, Transportation Bus Fees, Picnic Fees etc. <strong>Fees Group</strong> Fees Group is use to
                    make grouping of different Fees Type Then you can assign/allocate this Fees Group to whole
                    class-section or a particular student. When you assign/allocate a Fees Group on a class-section or a
                    particular student all Fees Type under this group with their Fees Master amount will be applied
                    directly. You can assign/allocate multiple Fees Groups on a class-section or a particular student.
                    Suppose we have created a Fees Group with the name Class 6 (2 Instalments) and added Fees Types
                    Admission Fees ($1000), 1st Instalment ($5000), 2nd Instalment ($5000) then assign/allocate this
                    Fees Group Class 6 (2 Instalments) on those students only who want to pay fees in 2 Instalments. You
                    can create another Fees Group with the name Class 6 (1 Instalments) and add Fees Type Admission Fees
                    ($1000), Full Instalment ($9500). You can also create another fees group with the name Class 6
                    Transport Fees and add Transport Fees as Fees Type and assign/allocate on those students who use
                    transport facility. <strong>Note: Fees Type and Fees Group are not dependent on Academic Session but
                        Fees Master is created session wise so you need to enter Fees Master data for every
                        session.</strong>

                                       <br><br>Now let's understand how Promote Student works. Promoting students to next session and class-section depends on two things, 1). Student is pass or fail in main examination and 2). Student will be continue in school or leaving from school. If student is pass and will continue to school, only then student will be promoted to next session and class-section. If student is fail and continue to school then students will be promoted to next session but class-section will be remain as it is. If student is pass but leaving to student then student will not be promoted to next session nor promoted to next class-section. This is the whole mechanism of Promote Student. Edu Smart Campus automatically manage promotion of session and class-section. To promote students first select Promote In Session, Class, Section and for every student select Current Result pass or fail and Next Session Status continue or leave and click on Promote button from bottom right.

                    <p>Zoom live class module uses https://zoom.us meetings service to create live classes for students and live meetings for staff members. In this module teacher or authorized person can create live classes for students based on timetable period and further students can join this class from student panel. Any authorized staff can create staff meetings and concerning staff can join this meetings. To use this module user must have installed zoom app in their device. In Edu Smart Campus Zoom Live Class module only creates Classes and Meetings using zoom API and users can start or join these classes or meetings further all processing and management done by https://zoom.us. If you are using Zoom paid account (like 10 host license) then you should create each host user zoom API credential and add it to Edu Smart Campus Zoom Live Class in Add Credential option present in teacher account. As Zoom doesn't provide simultaneously multiple Live Class start feature for single host even you are using zoom paid account so you should create multiple host account in zoom to run multiple simultaneous Live Classes started by each host.
                    <br><br>
                    Zoom Live Class Module Workflow: First we will add zoom account api credentials in setting page, then we will create zoom live class or meeting then we can start live class or meeting then student can join live class or staff can  join meeting further we can check join report for live class or meeting.

                    <strong>Note: Zoom Live Class is Edu Smart Campus addon so to use it you should purchase separately and install it in your School Management System.</strong></p>

In certificate design we will suggest you to try to edit certificate design parameters by edit as many time possible until you will get your perfect design. You have to adjust many time design parameters to get your perfect design. While adjusting design parameters take browser final print preview or print as pdf option from browser as final reference of print design by using <strong>Generate Certificate</strong> link. Otherwise in final print you will get little bit deviation in design. All Certificate designs can be see right side of this page.
